## Scala React app
This is a web application consisting of a Scala Play backend and a React front end. It is based on this blog post: https://blog.usejournal.com/react-with-play-framework-2-6-x-a6e15c0b7bd 

### Running the application: 
Navigate to the project's root directory and run the command:
```
sbt run
```
This will result in a Scala webserver running on localhost:9000 and a react-app being available on localhost:3000.
